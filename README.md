# *PROFILE*

work on putting my profile together so not only does it look nice but I can flip it around in vim.

 :tada:

also try to suss out markdown _y'know!_

 - [ ] did i do it?

## I guess we will **see** 

#### I want to plan this out a bit 

...but at the exact same time I want to play around a bit - there's the profile bit and what I'm trying to do.
There's the love affair with vim, linux generally and the cli, the new tmux fan club and powerline, zsh which I also love and touch typing in dvorak - there's working hard at getting there with github and looking for a community, which is super important to me and hopefully my work.
